> A Teaching Automatic Question Answering System applied in the Pattern Recognition class in WHU
Advisor: Weiping Zhu, Assistant Professor, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University
	Divided the system into five parts and implemented them: Problem classification, language processing, grading candidate answer, database modeling and user interface design.
	Conducted a pilot project in WHU and observed that the system has made contributions to the subject learning.
	Contributed to a first-auther paper to be summited to International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology
## Research Assistant | Deep Knowledge Tracing Project | UCB                                                   May 2018- Aug 2018
> Advisor: Zachary Pardos, Assistant Professor, Information school & Education school, UC Berkeley
	Personalized the test question order to let students get better performance in online test.
	Adopted LSTM to train the model, cleaned the data of students taking the test.
	Got the possibility as an output of the model, to which the student can get correct answer.
## Model Designer | Accurate Advertisement Recommendation System | WHU                              Mar 2017-Jul 2018
> Utilizing Machine Learning and Data Mining to Adjust Recommendation Algorithm in Advertisement Delivery
Advisor: Bing Li, Professor, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University
	Adopted BP neural network (strong mapping and learning ability) model to figure out relationship between advertisers, advertising position and product itself, produced optimal recommendation
	Utilized LBS (Location Based Services) to determine the consumption level of residents in each community
	Constructed the delivery strategy method utilizing recent advertisers’ transaction records(60+ communities)
## Project Member | Prediction Model of Energy Profile | COMAP                                                            Feb 2018
> 	Built time series model to fit the four states’ total energy consumption and renewable energy comsumption trend
	Conducted DW test to check whether the residual is autocorrelated or not
	Used ADF Test and KPSS test to test the residual’s stability
	Fitted the first-order difference by an ARMA process(the trend of residuals by ARIMA(p, 1, q) process)
	Conducted CUSUM Test and added crawled data from 2010 to 2015 to increase 80% accuracy
## Research Assistant | Evaluation and Forecasting System for NL | Citibank                              Mar 2017-Dec 2017 
> Setting up a Ranking List of Investment Value of Each Network Literature(NL) with Influence Factors
	Crawled 400k+ fictions using python on various websites, including search index, discussion heat, clicks, etc.
	Built  an effective evaluation model to find impact factors by K-means and PCA(reduce the dimensions of samples so that computation can be decreased at least 30%)
	Analyzed the novels by using  LDA, jieba,Collections packages in python and package FudanNLP in java
	Predicted the amount of click of each novel by utilizing ARIMA and LSTM(transfomation of RNN)
## Project Leader | Search Engine for Computer Education | WHU                                               Aug 2017-Dec 2017 
> Offering Authoritative Tutorials’ Link after Filtering Commercial and Useless Websites
Advisor: Weiping Zhu, Assistant Professor, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University
	Built our own network database via MySQL with only the courses’ name and its URL
	Conducted data statistics analysis by pandas package in Python to find top50 learning websites after investigating the whole CS department’s students
	Created a Web Project and built JSP server operating environment, using sql package to realize searching function
