 Correct answer is  (b)  

 Your score on this question is: 0.00  

 Feedback: 
   Programmers usually restate the program in terms that they are more comfortable with. This allows them to understand the problem better. This restatement is a redefinition of the problem. This restatement or redefinition is usually done in a manner that breaks the original problem down into smaller sub-problems that may be easier to solve. See section 2.1.6 in the course notes.

 The following is a Java program segment:

public void paint (Graphics g)
{
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    paintPicture( g, x, y);
}
public void paintPicture(Graphics g, int a, int b)
{
    g.setColor(Color.red);
    // more code follows
}

What will be the value of the parameter "a", in the method paintPicture when this code is executed?
 
 

  (a) 20
 (b) This will not compile. This is an error because the parameter "a" was never declared and never given a value.
 (c) 10
 (d) 0  

 Correct answer is  (c)  

 Your score on this question is: 0.00  

 Feedback: 
   The first argument of the call is the graphics object, "g" This value is transferred to the first formal argument (parameter) which is also called "g". The value of the second argument (parameter) in the call, "x" is transferred to the second formal argument (parameter), "a" so the formal argument (parameter), "a" will have a value of 10. The names do not have to be the same - just the types. The same is true for the third argument (parameter) in the call, "y". It s value is transferred to the third formal argument, "b" which will have a value of 20.

 Redefining a problem is often done so the programmer can  
 

  (a) reduce syntax errors in the program solution
 (b) understand the problem better
 (c) rewrite the problem using fewer words
 (d) write better comments in the program solution  

 Correct answer is  (b)  

 Your score on this question is: 5.88  

 Feedback: 
   Programmers usually restate the program in terms that they are more comfortable with. This allows them to understand the problem better. This restatement is a redefinition of the problem. This restatement or redefinition is usually done in a manner that breaks the original problem down into smaller sub-problems that may be easier to solve. See section 2.1.6 in the course notes.

 (b) planning --> coding --> testing --> analyzing
 (c) planning --> redefining--> coding--> testing
 (d) defining/redefining --> planning --> implementing/coding --> testing/analyzing  

 Correct answer is  (a)  

 Your score on this question is: 5.88  

 Feedback: 
   Programmers move into and out of the four phases in varying patterns. The programming process is not a linear or straight-line process. See section 2.1.6 in the course notes.

 The following is a Java program segment:

public void paint (Graphics g)
{
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    paintPicture( g, x, y);
}
public void paintPicture(Graphics g, int a, int b)
{
    g.setColor(Color.red);
    // more code follows
}

What will be the value of the parameter "a", in the method paintPicture when this code is executed?
 
 

  (a) This will not compile. This is an error because the parameter "a" was never declared and never given a value.
 (b) 20
 (c) 0
 (d) 10  

 Correct answer is  (d)  

 Your score on this question is: 5.88  

 Feedback: 
   The first argument of the call is the graphics object, "g" This value is transferred to the first formal argument (parameter) which is also called "g". The value of the second argument (parameter) in the call, "x" is transferred to the second formal argument (parameter), "a" so the formal argument (parameter), "a" will have a value of 10. The names do not have to be the same - just the types. The same is true for the third argument (parameter) in the call, "y". It s value is transferred to the third formal argument, "b" which will have a value of 20.

 Redefining a problem is often done so the programmer can 
 

  (a) reduce syntax errors in the program solution
 (b) write better comments in the program solution
 (c) rewrite the problem using fewer words
 (d) understand the problem better  

 Correct answer is  (d)  

 Your score on this question is: 5.88  

 Feedback: 
   Programmers usually restate the program in terms that they are more comfortable with. This allows them to understand the problem better. This restatement is a redefinition of the problem. This restatement or redefinition is usually done in a manner that breaks the original problem down into smaller sub-problems that may be easier to solve. See section 2.1.6 in the course notes.

 The following is a Java program segment:

public void paint (Graphics g)
{
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    paintPicture( g, x, y);
}
public void paintPicture(Graphics g, int a, int b)
{
    g.setColor(Color.red);
    // more code follows
}

What will be the value of the parameter "a", in the method paintPicture when this code is executed?
 
 

  (a) This will not compile. This is an error because the parameter "a" was never declared and never given a value.
 (b) 20
 (c) 0
 (d) 10  

 Correct answer is  (d)  

 Your score on this question is: 5.88  

 Feedback: 
   The first argument of the call is the graphics object, "g" This value is transferred to the first formal argument (parameter) which is also called "g". The value of the second argument (parameter) in the call, "x" is transferred to the second formal argument (parameter), "a" so the formal argument (parameter), "a" will have a value of 10. The names do not have to be the same - just the types. The same is true for the third argument (parameter) in the call, "y". It s value is transferred to the third formal argument, "b" which will have a value of 20.

What will be the value of the parameter "a", in the method paintPicture when this code is executed?
 
 

  (a) 20
 (b) 0
 (c) This will not compile. This is an error because the parameter "a" was never declared and never given a value.
 (d) 10  

 Correct answer is  (d)  

 Your score on this question is: 5.88  

 Feedback: 
   The first argument of the call is the graphics object, "g" This value is transferred to the first formal argument (parameter) which is also called "g". The value of the second argument (parameter) in the call, "x" is transferred to the second formal argument (parameter), "a" so the formal argument (parameter), "a" will have a value of 10. The names do not have to be the same - just the types. The same is true for the third argument (parameter) in the call, "y". It s value is transferred to the third formal argument, "b" which will have a value of 20.
