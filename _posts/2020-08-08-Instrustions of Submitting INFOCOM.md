## Paper submission process

All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using **EDAS**. If the submitting author does not have an account, a personal account on EDAS needs to be created. When submitting the paper, a title, all the co-authors, and a concise abstract of up to 200 words should be provided to EDAS as the **metadata of the paper**. The metadata should be provided before the paper registration deadline. The list of authors should not be included in the paper manuscript PDF (PDF title page, main body, and PDF metadata), in accordance to the double-blind submission policy.` **Changes to the paper metadata on EDAS are permitted`** before the paper submission deadline, which will be Saturday, 15 August 2020, 11:59pm EDT.


## Submission Instructions

Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere will be considered. Technical papers `must be `submitted via the EDAS Paper Processing System. Submitted papers should be written in the English language, with **`a maximum length limit of 10`** printed pages. Main text (including figures, tables, appendices, and any material **other than references**) should be no more than 9 pages.  All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through **double-blind reviewing**, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. Authors are required to make sure that the complete list of authors are provided as part of the metadata to EDAS, however, the list of authors should not be included in the paper PDF document in accordance to the double-blind submission policy.
