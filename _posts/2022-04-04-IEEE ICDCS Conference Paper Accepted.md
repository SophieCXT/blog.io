## Won ICDCS 2022 Travel Grant Award
Congratulations!!

We are pleased to inform you that your paper #545 (Joint Caching and Routing in Cache Networks with Arbitrary Topology), has been accepted for inclusion in the IEEE ICDCS 2022 technical program. The selection process was very competitive this year. Out of 573 submissions, only 114 were accepted (19.9% acceptance rate).

## Description:
In-network caching and flexible routing are two of the most celebrated advantages of next generation network infrastructures. Yet few solutions are available for jointly optimizing caching and routing that provide performance guarantees for an arbitrary topology. We take a holistic approach towards this fundamental problem by analyzing its complexity in all the cases and developing polynomial-time algorithms with approximation guarantees in important special cases. We also reveal the fundamental challenge in achieving guaranteed approximation in the general case and propose an alternating optimization algorithm with good performance and fast convergence. Our algorithms have demonstrated superior performance in both routing cost and congestion compared to the state-of-the-art solutions in evaluations based on real topology and request traces.
