## Volunteer Counselor at CSE Camp for Girls & Girls Who Code (Penn State University):
My journey in education and mentorship has been equally rewarding. Since February 2022, I have been serving as a Volunteer Counselor at the CSE Camp for Girls and Girls Who Code at Penn State University. In this role, I've had the opportunity to mentor discussions and provide guidance in programming languages such as Python and C#. Additionally, I've instructed students in the exciting world of Android-based VR and AR programming using Unity 3D. These sessions involved hands-on experiences with VR glasses, including captivating demos and 3D drawing.

## What Drives Me:
My passion for Health Qigong and my commitment to education stem from the same source – a desire to make a positive impact. Whether it's mastering the art of Qigong or sharing my knowledge with the next generation of tech enthusiasts, my journey is a testament to the power of perseverance and a willingness to learn and teach.

In both domains, I've learned that excellence comes from dedication, resilience, and a genuine love for what you do. I am excited to continue this journey, honing my skills in both Qigong and mentoring, and I'm always eager to explore new opportunities to inspire and learn from those around me.

My role goes beyond just teaching; it's about fostering a love for technology, nurturing creativity, and igniting curiosity. By offering hands-on experiences with VR glasses, conducting engaging demos, and guiding 3D drawing sessions, I've aimed to make the learning process not only educational but also incredibly fun.

At the PSU Camp for Girls, I'm driven by the belief that every young mind has the potential to achieve greatness, and I'm here to help them realize that potential. Together with my fellow mentors and counselors, I am dedicated to empowering and equipping these aspiring tech enthusiasts with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in the ever-evolving world of computer science. It's been an incredibly rewarding journey, and I look forward to continuing this adventure of education, mentorship, and inspiring the tech leaders of tomorrow.


Join me as I embark on this fulfilling path of self-improvement, mentorship, and a lifelong commitment to well-being and education. The possibilities are endless, and I'm ready to embrace them all.
