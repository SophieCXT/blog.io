## My Volunteer Experience at the CSE Summer Camp 2024

This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer at the CSE Summer Camp 2024, and it was an experience that I will cherish for a long time. The camp was a whirlwind of excitement, learning, and fun, filled with eager young minds ready to dive into the world of computer science.

From the moment the camp started, the energy was palpable. The first day began with an introduction to computer science, and it was amazing to see how quickly the students grasped the fundamental concepts. One of the highlights was the "CS without computers" session, where we explored fascinating activities like programming tic-tac-toe and creating a candy computer. These hands-on exercises demonstrated that computer science is not just about sitting in front of a screen but also about understanding the logic and creativity behind it.

As the week progressed, the students were introduced to Minecraft, which quickly became a favorite. Watching them navigate the virtual world, set up their environments, and start coding within the game was truly inspiring. The excitement in the room was contagious as they learned about conditionals, loops, and variables, all while having a blast in Minecraft.

One of the most memorable moments for me was the session on creating AI. The students worked on projects like a teachable machine happy/sad classifier and a smart classroom simulation. It was incredible to see their faces light up as they realized the potential of AI and how it can be applied to everyday scenarios. The creativity and enthusiasm they brought to these projects were nothing short of amazing.

But perhaps the most fun and intriguing activity of all was learning about hexaflexagons. This seemingly simple paper-folding exercise turned into a delightful exploration of geometry and patterns. The students were fascinated by how a flat piece of paper could transform into a flexible, multi-faced shape. It was a perfect example of how computer science principles can be found in the most unexpected places. The joy and curiosity on their faces as they folded and flexed their hexaflexagons were priceless.

Throughout the camp, the instructors, Dan Kifer and Timmy Zhu, did an outstanding job of making complex topics accessible and engaging. Their passion for teaching and their ability to connect with the students made the learning experience enjoyable for everyone involved.

As the camp came to a close, we celebrated with an ice cream social, which was the perfect way to wrap up an incredible week. The students shared their projects, demonstrated what they had learned, and enjoyed some well-deserved treats. It was heartwarming to see the sense of accomplishment and pride in their eyes.

Volunteering at the CSE Summer Camp 2024 was an unforgettable experience. It was a joy to see young minds light up with curiosity and excitement, and to be a part of their journey into the world of computer science. I am already looking forward to next year's camp and the new adventures it will bring!

If you ever have the chance to volunteer or participate in a similar event, I highly recommend it. The experience is not only rewarding but also a wonderful reminder of the endless possibilities that come with learning and exploring new ideas.
