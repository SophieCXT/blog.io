# Volunteering with Girls Who Code Program at Penn State

This February, I had the privilege of volunteering with the Girls Who Code Club at Penn State, a free coding club designed for local middle and high school students. The club provides a welcoming and inclusive environment for young learners to explore the world of coding and technology.

## Empowering Future Coders

The primary goal of this club is to empower the next generation of young coders. Over the course of several weeks, students have the opportunity to delve into introductory coding concepts and enhance their existing coding skills. The main programming language of focus is Python, known for its accessibility and versatility. In addition to Python, students explore various special topics like web design and game development.

## Project Development and Mentorship

As the program progresses, students are given one-on-one mentorship to work on individual projects that allow them to apply their newfound coding skills creatively. This hands-on experience is an invaluable part of their learning journey as they showcase their innovative projects at the end of the program.

## Expanding Horizons with "Tech Talks"

To broaden students' horizons and expose them to the vast world of computer science, the Girls Who Code Club hosts weekly "Tech Talks." During these sessions, guest speakers from diverse tech backgrounds deliver engaging presentations, introducing students to an array of exciting topics in the field.

## Passionate Educators

The club is led by dedicated Penn State undergraduate and graduate students who have a strong background in computing and technology. Their passion for sharing knowledge and fostering an interest in coding is evident in their teaching.

The Girls Who Code Club at Penn State plays a crucial role in bridging the gender gap in the tech industry by inspiring young girls to explore their potential in the world of coding and computer science. This volunteering experience has not only allowed me to contribute to this mission but has also been a source of inspiration and motivation for my own journey in the tech world.

>I submitted my application to serve as the chair of Girls Who Code (GWC) in the summer of 2023. With a host of fresh ideas, I aim to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge delivery to the younger generation.
