## Pass the comprehensive exam
Dear Tian Xie
A departmental report indicates that you have passed the comprehensive examination. A
notation to this effect will be entered on your official record.
Please note that if you conduct research with human subjects, animals, or hazardous materials,
including radioisotopes, it is imperative that you secure the appropriate approvals BEFORE the
research is conducted. Please note that these types of approvals CANNOT BE OBTAINED
RETROACTIVELY.
In the event that you do perform your research without prior approval: (1) It will not be
possible to have the work published; (2) it is possible that your thesis will not be approved
by the Graduate School; and (3) under certain circumstances, it may compromise
conferral of the graduate degree.
If you have questions regarding this requirement, or how to obtain the necessary approval(s),
please discuss this with your mentor, program chair, or contact the Office of Research
Protections (814-865-1775).
Congratulations on your achievement and best wishes as you proceed with your doctoral
program.
Sincerely,
Lori A. Hawn
Director of Graduate Student Services
