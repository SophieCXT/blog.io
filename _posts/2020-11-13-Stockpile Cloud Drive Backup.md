I have also added a setting that will automatically map the drive for you.

If you are referring to your research disk space then just map a drive to \\stockpile\nsrg.

When you get a chance please log out and then log back in. If the drive is still present you should be able to disconnect it and then re-connect using your CSE credentials. You may be prompted to enter your CSE credentials twice. It may even take a machine reboot to clear the mapping.
