## Paper submission process
 use your PSU credentials,  PSU\tbx5027 and PSU password
 
  the hostname would be e5-cse-364-04 and you would use your PSU credentials.
  
The Windows and Ubuntu machines in the NSRG lab will will be migrated into the PSU domain on Tuesday morning.  After migration you will still have access to and be using your local Windows profile on the machine and access to the machine will be identical to what it was before.  The only difference will be the hostname which will be changed to e5-cse-LabRm#(362 or 364 in this case)-## (the ## is identical to what it was previously) and you will use your PSU credentials to log in to the machine.

The Ubuntu machines will continue to mount your CSE homedir along with your PSU PASS space and PSU U drive.
